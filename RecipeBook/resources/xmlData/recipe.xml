            <ingredientList>
                <ingredient>15 slices thick-cut bacon </ingredient>
                <ingredient>6 cups all-purpose flour</ingredient>
                <ingredient>2 Tbsp baking powder </ingredient>
                <ingredient>1½ tsp baking soda</ingredient>
                <ingredient>¼ cup sugar </ingredient>
                <ingredient>2¼ tsp kosher salt </ingredient>
                <ingredient>2 cups cold unsalted butter, cut into ½ inch cubes </ingredient>
                <ingredient>½ cup cold maple syrup</ingredient>
                <ingredient>¾ cup cold buttermilk</ingredient>
                <ingredient>2 egg yolks </ingredient>
                <ingredient>Fleur de sel or Maldon sea salt </ingredient>
                <ingredient>¾ cup extra maple syrup for glaze</ingredient>
            </ingredientList>

            <instruction>
                <paragraph>
                	Chop the bacon in 0.5 inch pieces and cook them in two batches in a frying pan over medium-high heat until crispy. Reserve 2 Tbsp of the bacon fat and let the bacon drip on paper towels. 
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                	In a very large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt and toss well. Throw in the cold butter and work it with your fingertips until the pieces are pea- and lima bean-size. Add the ½ cup maple syrup, buttermilk, bacon and reserved bacon fat. Lightly toss to distribute.

                <paragraph>
                	Immediately dump everything onto a clean surface with more than enough space to work the dough. Using only the heel of your palm quickly flatten out the dough. Gather the dough back together in a mound and repeat. After two or three repetitions, the dough should begin holding together. Be sure to avoid overworking. You should still see some pea-size bits of butter running through it. 
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
			        Flatten the dough into a 1 inch thickness and cut out the scones with a glass or cookie cutter. Transfer them to an ungreased sheet pan. Very gently push the scraps back together and cut once more. Freeze for at least 2 hours before baking, or for up to 1 month, tightly wrapped.

		        <paragraph>
			        Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the scones from the freezer. Space them with plenty of breathing room on two ungreased sheet pans. Make the egg wash by mixing the egg yolks with the heavy cream and kosher salt and brush the scones with the egg wash and sprinkle with the fleur de sel. Bake from frozen, until cooked through and starting to brown, about 20 minutes. Pour 2 tsp maple syrup over each scone to glaze and bake 5 minutes longer.

                </ingredient>
                <ingredient>
                    400 g risotto rice
                </ingredient>
                <ingredient>
                    2 wineglasses dry white vermouth or dry white wine
                </ingredient>
                <ingredient>
                    sea salt
                </ingredient>
                <ingredient>
                    freshly ground black pepper
                </ingredient>
                <ingredient>
                    1 knob of butter
                </ingredient>
                <ingredient>
                    90 g Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
                </ingredient>
            </ingredientList>

            <instruction>
                <paragraph>
                    Heat the stock. In a separate pan, heat the olive oil and butter, add the onions, garlic and celery, and fry very slowly for about 15 minutes without colouring. When the vegetables have softened, add the rice and turn up the heat.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    The rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep stirring it. After a minute it will look slightly transparent. Add the vermouth or wine and keep stirring — it will smell fantastic. Any harsh alcohol flavours will evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty essence
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a good pinch of salt. Turn down the heat to a simmer so the rice doesn't cook too quickly on the outside. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock, stirring and almost massaging the creamy starch out of the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This will take around 15 minutes. Taste the rice — is it cooked? Carry on adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. Don't forget to check the seasoning carefully. If you run out of stock before the rice is cooked, add some boiling water.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>
                    Remove from the heat and add the butter and Parmesan. Stir well. Place a lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 minutes. This is the most important part of making the perfect risotto, as this is when it becomes outrageously creamy and oozy like it should be. Eat it as soon as possible, while the risotto retains its beautiful texture.
